# High Score Pong
High Score Pong is a captivating single-player game inspired by the classic Brick Breaker. 
In this game, your objective is to achieve the highest number of successful collisions with the ball.

Rather than breaking tiles, the focus is on skillfully hitting the ball with your paddle to rack up points. 
Each successful collision will not only earn you points but also increase the speed of the ball, intensifying the challenge as you progress.
