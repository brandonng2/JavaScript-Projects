# Crytopgraphy

Cryptography is a project focused on decrypting encrypted messages. It employs frequency analysis to tally the occurrence of each letter in the collected ciphertext and compares the percentages against the average frequencies found in the English language.

This project also allows users to encrypt messages using a simple letter substitution technique known as the Caesar cipher that shifts the letters of a given text by a specified number.
